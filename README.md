# BMED-Tranport-reaction-model-
Modified BMED transport-reaction model for BMED flue gas absorption-mineralization system  
# Part 1
**main_sys.mlx** is the main program used to calculate the ion concentration change during electrodialysis gas absorption.  
**pitzer_cons.mlx** is the function used to construct the pitzer modeling framework.  
**flux.mlx** is the function used to calculate the flux of ions across the membrane.  
**mass2.mlx** is the function used to calculate the mass balance of the membrane stack.  
**react.mlx** is the function used to calculate the reaction during the BMED process.  
**pitzer_mod.mlx** is a pitzer model for calculating solution density, osmotic pressure.  
**pitzer_alpha_gai.mat** is the database of the pitzer model.  
# Part 2  
**exergy_4.mlx** is used to calculate exergy during system operation.  
**fun_exergy4.mlx** is the function used to calculate exergy during system operation.  
**fluxLR.mlx** is the function used to calculate the flux of ions across the membrane's right and left side.  
**pitzer_mod_ex.mlx** is a pitzer model for calculating solution density in exergy calculation.
